# ApolloProposals

//PROJECT
For our second group project at <Code For All_> #104 in Porto’s bootcamp, we tackled a real-world enterprise challenge: building a tool that helps teams respond to Requests for Proposals (RFPs) faster, more consistently, and more intelligently. The brief pushed us to think beyond just code—it asked us to solve a complex knowledge management problem in a high-pressure business context.

//THE IDEA
We aimed to build an AI-assisted proposal management platform that allows teams to store, search, and reuse past RFP content while tailoring new responses to specific clients. The idea was to bridge the gap between chaotic document storage and the need for fast, precise, and personalized proposals. We designed a system where users could easily find relevant past answers, generate new ones aligned with client tone, and improve over time by learning from previous responses.

//DEVELOPMENT
We began by breaking the challenge down into four key areas: information structure, intelligent search, content tailoring, and feedback learning. The backend team focused on building a RESTful API with Spring Boot to handle proposals, categories, and user input. On the frontend, we built a clean, user-friendly interface for uploading past RFPs, generating tailored responses, and reviewing suggestions. We integrated a basic AI component to suggest content based on user queries and past data, and structured our database to allow for semantic search and content tagging.

As the deadline neared, we brought everything together: from file upload and content parsing to client-specific proposal generation. Testing, polishing, and syncing the two ends was a race against the clock, but we delivered a working MVP that hit every challenge question posed in the brief.

//FINAL THOUGHTS
This project taught us how to approach a real-world enterprise problem with both a technical and strategic mindset. We not only had to build a product, but we had to think about UX, content quality, and long-term adaptability. While there's still much we’d like to refine—especially on the AI training side—we’re proud of what we accomplished and eager to keep improving it beyond the bootcamp.
